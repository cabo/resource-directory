Another possible exception is the RD (or something interacting with it) making more statements true, eg. by registering the nodes's address in the DNS and thus making a resolvable (and possibly more stable) name available for use in con.\r\n\r\n* An RD registration can only be updated using the registration resource (which typically only the origin device knows).\r\n\r\n  If some entity (eg. a DNS-SD bridge) wants to update a resource's description (eg. change an instance name or rename an endpoint), they have to find (possibly through the RD) if and where the origin server allows such modification, and put the changes there.\r\n\r\nAre those agreeable principles, and what else belongs in that category?"

That is hard for the individual device to support out of the box short of adding its serial number to everything, and (given it's not a MUST) still insufficient for an RD exporter (eg. to DNS-SD) to use.\r\n\r\nIn the last meeting, labels for distinguishing two instances in a combined devices came up (two fridge compartments, `ins=\"upper\"` and `ins=\"lower\"`), which would violate that constraint when two fridges are present in one domain.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to either relax the uniqueness requirements and have whoever exports this to DNS-SD deal with the resulting ambiguities[1], or make them strict enough for ins= conflicts to fail early (an absent ins= would be such a conflict too, or is that a free pass to construct an `ins` at will?), and suggest a different mechanism for \"upper\"/\"lower\" distinctions (title?).\r\n\r\n[1]: For example, as is done in the Z-Wave-IP, see design specification 4.1.2.3: \"If several End Point Name and End Point Location entries are identical, the Z/IP RD MUST auto-append unique data to each of the conflicting End Point Names\""
