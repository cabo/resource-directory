    "body": "Working with the ER model of `.well-known/core` in preparation of explanations around the use of anchor and href, I noticed that the model is something between a model of the link-format serializations and the web links data model.\r\n\r\nIt uses much of the serialization's terminology (\"anchor\" and \"href\"), and refers to some cardinalities as they appear in the serialization (eg. anchor is 0-1 because it may be omitted), but at other places alludes to the data model (eg. rel has cardinality 0+, which reflects that a link can have several relations, but in the serialization they all get space-joint into 0-1 rel parameters).\r\n\r\nThe model is now much closer to the serialization than the semantic model, and I think we should stay with that to keep the document from becoming too abstract. (Plus, I don't know which applications start breaking when we make `</a>;rel=x;foo=bar,</a>;rel=y;foo=baz` into `</a>;rel=\"x y\";foo=bar;foo=baz` which we could when we say the RD's data model is the abstract web linking model).\r\n\r\nAre we OK with the model reflecting the serialization and not the semantics?\r\n\r\nIf if should reflect the serialization, the only discrepancies I spotted are that cardinality of rel and con are 0-1 (that count being low is probably another hint that it should stay this way)."

(The RD interface right now doesn't allow a 4.01 Unauthorized response, even though the security considerations indicate that that can happen.)\r\n\r\nThis would allow endpoints that have just enough persistent state to have their cryptographic identity in form of a PSK to register at the RD. Note that for those cases (and PSK seems not to be too uncommon in the CoRE security scenarios), the RD already needs to have received (or have a way to fetch) configuration about that key, which easily can contain a default (or the only permissible) endpoint name for that key.\r\n\r\nI'd write a pull request to that respect unless controversial discussion about this starts here.\r\n\r\n(This was fleshed out from in a discussion with Pekka Nikander during ACM ICN about very constrained devices)."

    "body": "So, with this new understanding I am going to try some different questions\r\nabout PATCH.\r\n\r\n1.  Is there a good reason to support the addition of new resources in two\r\ndifferent methods?  Addition of new resources can already be done through\r\nthe POST method, needing to recognize that the documents to be patched are\r\ndifferent is a potential error waiting to happen if this is not well\r\ndescribed in document.\r\n\r\n2.  For the delete case, the patch string of {\"href\":null}  is more in line\r\nwith how I understand a JSON patch document to be designed.  The string of\r\n{} would say that nothing is to be changed by default unless it is special\r\ncased.  Setting the value of the href to absent or null would be easily\r\nunderstood as saying remove the element.\r\n\r\n3.  The text on patch needs to be clear on how to treat a patch document\r\nwhere multiple occurrences of an attribute to modify occur in the patch\r\ndocument.  It should also be clearer on the correct way to deal with\r\nupdating multiple occurrences of the attribute in the link document.  My\r\nreading of the current text could end up with \"</foo>;alpha=beta;alpha=beta\"\r\nas the output if the input was \"</foo>;alpha=gamma;alpha=delta\" and the\r\npatch was {alpha:\"beta\"}.   I am not sure that is what you want to be\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n4.  This paragraph is missing some text I believe:\r\n\r\nIf the PATCH payload results in the modification of link target,\r\n   context, or relation values, that is \"href\", \"rel\", or \"anchor\", the\r\n   request SHOULD be rejected with a \"Conflict\" result code.\r\n\r\nWhy is this a SHOULD and not a MUST.  If you keep it as a MUST some guidance\r\non which rejections SHOULD occur and when they are acceptable would be\r\nhighly desirable.  Making it a MUST means that a Conflict response would not\r\nbe able to occur if I have my logic correct for anything other than an\r\naddition request."

    "body": "\r\nJim Schaad schreef op 2017-09-06 00:14:\r\nOne of the issues that I just come up with, and might be part of an I\r\ndon't care space, is that if an endpoint has two different addresses\r\nthen the registration resource cannot have two different addresses\r\nassociated with it.  You cannot have two different registration\r\nresources with the same endpoint name.  This means if I want to\r\nregister both IPv6 and IPv4 (or\r\nother address types) with the same endpoint there is a problem.   I\r\nalso\r\njust realized that same issue arises with schema.  These only apply if\r\nyou want to use the context parameter.  If you are going to supply\r\nfull URL addresses to resources then this is doable.  Given that the\r\ncontext parameter is for space savings, I wonder if some method of\r\ndealing with this should be considered.  Possibly defining some type\r\nof context selector or something?\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\nIndeed this is an issue that was also brought up by Dave Thaler, where he\r\nreferred to the multiple types of coap schemes that became possible.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, we made the model such that and extension to multiple\r\ncontexts is possible, but not yet supported by the RD, given that all\r\nthese\r\nextensions are still under discussion,\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nOne way that I have thought of dealing with this is to extend the check on\r\nendpoint uniqueness from <domain, endpoint> to <domain, endpoint, context>.\r\nThe only downside that I can see is that it makes the query on the endpoint\r\nresource slightly more complicated.\r\n"

There are no methods defined for modifying the contents of a group.\r\nThere is only a method for replacing the contents entirely.  Is this\r\nintentional?\r\n\r\n2.  The description of the context parameter looks to be a cut and paste\r\nthat you did not review.  If the parameter is absent, I do not believe that\r\nit makes sense to try and infer a context.  My assumption is that a context\r\nis only going to supplied in the event that a multicast address is\r\nassociated with the group.\r\n\r\n3.  Similar to the request for a GET on the resource directory to get the\r\nlist of resource registries, I believe that you should have a GET on the\r\ngroup directory to get the list of group registries."

I am unclear if the context is what should be returned as the link\r\naddress for an endpoint or if it is just the scheme + authority (i.e.\r\nomit\r\nany path portion).\r\n\r\nI find the concatenation of \"con\" and \"href\" values, as currently\r\nsuggested in\r\nthe examples, also difficult to understand.\r\nIMO the href value should be returned between <> brackets, and the con as\r\nan additional attribute.\r\n\r\nI would find that logical, even if it makes the client side more difficult\r\nto build the entire URI.\r\n\r\n3.  For the domain and group lookups, is the href an empty string or\r\nis it absent?  This does not make a different for the standard link\r\nformation, but it does make a difference for the cbor and json\r\nformats.\r\n\r\n@ Michael can you answer, being involved in the link-json document\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  I assume that the 'et' parameter should be returned on all end\r\npoints.\r\net can have no value; IMO do not return anything.\r\n\r\nDo you mean, do not synthesis a value from the registration and add it?\r\nThat would be fine with me.\r\n\r\n5.  How would an empty domain name be returned (this is my current\r\npre-configured default domain) - as an empty string or as just the\r\nattribute name - i.e  d  or d=\"\" ?\r\n\r\nActually the d= can have no value, and IMO like et, do not return anything\r\nwhen there is no value.\r\n"

Another possible exception is the RD (or something interacting with it) making more statements true, eg. by registering the nodes's address in the DNS and thus making a resolvable (and possibly more stable) name available for use in con.\r\n\r\n* An RD registration can only be updated using the registration resource (which typically only the origin device knows).\r\n\r\n  If some entity (eg. a DNS-SD bridge) wants to update a resource's description (eg. change an instance name or rename an endpoint), they have to find (possibly through the RD) if and where the origin server allows such modification, and put the changes there.\r\n\r\nAre those agreeable principles, and what else belongs in that category?"

That is hard for the individual device to support out of the box short of adding its serial number to everything, and (given it's not a MUST) still insufficient for an RD exporter (eg. to DNS-SD) to use.\r\n\r\nIn the last meeting, labels for distinguishing two instances in a combined devices came up (two fridge compartments, `ins=\"upper\"` and `ins=\"lower\"`), which would violate that constraint when two fridges are present in one domain.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to either relax the uniqueness requirements and have whoever exports this to DNS-SD deal with the resulting ambiguities[1], or make them strict enough for ins= conflicts to fail early (an absent ins= would be such a conflict too, or is that a free pass to construct an `ins` at will?), and suggest a different mechanism for \"upper\"/\"lower\" distinctions (title?).\r\n\r\n[1]: For example, as is done in the Z-Wave-IP, see design specification 4.1.2.3: \"If several End Point Name and End Point Location entries are identical, the Z/IP RD MUST auto-append unique data to each of the conflicting End Point Names\""
